# Parts Manufacturing - Quality Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the quality of parts manufactured in an industrial setting. The Jupyter Notebook in this repository covers data preprocessing, quality control checks, statistical analysis, and visualizations to assess the overall manufacturing quality and identify key areas for improvement.

## Features

- Import and preprocessing of manufacturing data.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) including visualizations to reveal data trends and outliers.
- Statistical tests to determine part quality consistency.
- Data-driven insights to guide quality assurance strategies.

## Installation
 To run this project, ensure that Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed. Install the necessary Python packages by running:

```bash Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash Copy code
jupyter notebook parts-manufacturing-quality-analysis.ipynb
```
- Run each cell in sequence to perform the analysis.
- Modify and adapt the code as needed for additional datasets or different manufacturing parameters.
Data
Ensure you have the necessary input data (e.g., CSV or Excel files containing manufacturing details). The script expects structured data with relevant columns such as part IDs, quality metrics, and timestamps.

## Output
The analysis provides:

- Descriptive statistics on part quality.
- Visual graphs and charts for better understanding of data distribution and anomalies.
- Recommendations based on the analysis to enhance manufacturing processes.
